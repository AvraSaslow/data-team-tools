# Data Team Tools Repository

This repository was created to store tools that the Resource Watch Data Team uses in their workflow. Each folder may contain one tool or a set of tools that have a very similar function.

To use the tools in this repository, you will want to follow these steps: 
1. Create a folder on your computer where you want to store these tools.
2. [Clone the data-team-tools repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to the folder you just created.

Each tool (or group of tools) may have special instructions or require additional software. Please review the README.md file inside each folder for further instructions.
