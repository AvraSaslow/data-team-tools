**Editing Resource Watch Layers**

This folder contains Python notebooks for editing layers in the Resource Watch backoffice.

Folder contents:
1. **Edit_Carto_Layers.ipynb**: This Python notebook helps you to edit Carto layers from the back office.
2. **Edit_GEE_Layers.ipynb**: This Python notebook helps you to edit GEE layers from the back office.

Each Python notebook follows the same process and gives you instructions within the notebook on how to run them.
To run each of the notebooks, do the following:
1. Download the .ipynb file.
2. Open the file in the [Jupyter Notebook Editor](https://jupyter.org/install).
3. Run each cell within the notebook, following the instructions in each, and fill in information when necessary. You will need the dataset ID for the dataset you want to edit layers and your API token.
