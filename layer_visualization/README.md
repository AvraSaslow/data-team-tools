**Layer Visualization**

This folder contains the tools used to aid in designing visualizations for datasets on Resource Watch. Each tool gives you instructions within on how to run them.

Currently, only tools to aid in visualizing raster layers have been created. To use these tools, you will want to follow these steps: 
1. Make sure you have a Google Earth Engine account. If you do not have an account, you can make one for free [here](https://earthengine.google.com/).
2. Open the appropriate tool, based on type of data you have:
    - [categorical raster data visualizations](https://code.earthengine.google.com/93a39110d7fc30514c76747cd5b99cdd)
    - [quantitative raster data visualizations](https://code.earthengine.google.com/bd95730e83b67ab0bec2e221e0c3e057)
3. Follow the instructions in the tool that you are using.
4. When you are finished making a visualization, save the edited version of the tool as *wri_id_public_title* in the *users/resourcewatch/default/ResourceWatch* folder in Google Earth Engine. This will allow you to easily modify the visualization later, if needed.
