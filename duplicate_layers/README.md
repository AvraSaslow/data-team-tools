**Duplicating Resource Watch Layers**

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for editing and duplicating layers in the Resource Watch backoffice.

Folder contents:
1. **Duplicate_Raster_Layers.ipynb**: This Python notebook helps you to duplicate GEE layers from the backoffice.
2. **Duplicate_Vector_Layers.ipynb**: This Python notebook helps you to duplicate Carto layers from the backoffice.
3. **LMIPy_Duplicate_Layers_No_Change.ipynb**: This Python notebook duplicates layers and only changes the name of the new layer.

Each Jupyter Notebook follows the same process and gives you instructions within the notebook on how to run them.
To run each of the notebooks, do the following:
1. Download the .ipynb file.
2. Open the file in the [Jupyter Notebook Editor](https://jupyter.org/install).
3. Run each cell within the notebook, following the instructions in each, and fill in information when necessary. You will need the dataset ID for the dataset you want to edit layers and your API token.
