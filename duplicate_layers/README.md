This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for editing and duplicating layers in the Resource Watch backoffice.

Folder contents:
1. Duplicate_Raster_Layers.ipynb: this file allows you to duplicate GEE layers from the backoffice
2. Duplicate_Vector_Layers.ipynb: this file allows you to duplicate Carto layers from the backoffice
3. LMIPy_Duplicate_Layers_No_Change.ipynb: this file duplicates layers and only changes the name of the new layer.

Each Jupyter Notebook follows the same process and gives you instructions within the notebook on how to run them.
To run each of the notebooks, do the following:
1. Download the .ipynb file
2. Open the file in the [Jupyter Notebook Editor](https://jupyter.org/install)
3. Run the cells and fill in information when necessary. Be ready with the dataset ID you want to edit layers and your API token.
