**Create Vega Configuration for Advanced Widgets**

This folder contains jupyter notebooks that can be used to create vega configuration for advanced widgets on Resource Watch. Each notebook allows you to create one type of chart. There are instructions within to guide you through the process.

The notebooks are mostly based on Altair and ipywidgets functions. You can find detailed documentation of these two libraries at [https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) and [https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

 More notebooks may be added in the future for additional types of charts.
