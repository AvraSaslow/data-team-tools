**Clone Datasets**

This folder contains the a script that can be used to clone a dataset on Resource Watch. The script gives you instructions within on how to run it.

This script is based on LMIPy module functions; however, these functions were not working as intended. Therefore, the code was copied and modified so that it would correctly clone a dataset.

This script may be further modified to introduce more flexibility into the dataset cloning.
